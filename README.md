# FinSphera Frontend Technical Assessment

## Welcome to my application for the FinSphera Challenge.

The application was created with ViteJS React + Typescript as required and consists of a list of the most popular movies of the moment. You will be able to see the poster and name of each movie, by clicking on any of them you will be able to see more details about it.
There is also a login page available that, as the challenge indications say, validates the form fields and once valid redirects to the main page.
The application was deployed with the help of Vercel at the following link:

Open [https://frontend-challenge-five-omega.vercel.app/](https://frontend-challenge-five-omega.vercel.app/) to view in the browser.

## Pre requirements

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm test -- --watch` (watch mode)

You will be able to run the tests and see all the process with the interactive watch mode.\

## Libraries used

## Additional notes

If I had more time I would like to have added a Select component to select the type of movie listing and change the movies displayed in the page. The TMDB have 4 tipes of movie lists:

- Popular
- Now Playing
- Top Rated
- Upcoming.
